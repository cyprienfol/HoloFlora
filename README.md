## Description
This repository contains the official implementation of the methodology presented in *"Advancing Forest Biodiversity Visualization through Mixed Reality,"* enabling users to visualize biodiversity indicators, such as tree-related microhabitats, for education, training, and conservation decision-making.

## HoloLens 2 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Create a Data Folder
Follow the steps described in the official Microsoft documentation to install the app on HoloLens 2: [App Deployment with App Installer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/app-deploy-app-installer).

### Step 3: Find the Augmented Reality Experience in Baden Marteloscope
Head out to the Baden Marteloscope and explore the area until you find tree 241. You can refer to the map of the marteloscope available [here](http://iplus.efi.int/uploads/CH_InfoSheet_Baden_en.pdf).

### Step 4: Start HoloFlora
Start HoloFlora and enjoy your first mixed reality forest visit!

### Running HoloFlora
